# Vibe Coding Stack Setup (Continue + OpenCode)

This folder contains starter configuration files for the hackathon vibe-coding setup.

Each team receives one OpenRouter API key with a budget limit of 20€.

You can use your OpenRouter API key however you like. To make onboarding easier, we provide ready-to-use config files and instructions for:

* Continue.dev for VS Code
* OpenCode for terminal-based agentic coding

The provided configurations use models that are reasonably priced while still being powerful enough for productive hacking.

# Important

* Do not commit your API key.
* Do not share your API key with other teams.
* Your team has a 20 € budget limit for the hackathon.
* This should be enough for one day of hacking, but agentic coding can consume budget quickly.

To avoid burning through your budget too fast:

* Start with the default cheaper model.
* Use premium models only when needed.
* Avoid long-running agent loops.
* Avoid prompts like “keep going until everything is perfect”.
* Break work into smaller tasks.
